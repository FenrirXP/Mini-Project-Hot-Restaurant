//I want an application that records table reservations and has a wait list
//I want to create a button that gives the user the option to reserve


//when the customer first visits the site, they are given two options
//there is the view tables and make reservation tables
//view tables will display my five tables with customer info
//and also show the wait list that also has customer info

//the make reservation button will take customer to prompt screen
//to fill out their information

//I need to implement a code in the backend that will take customers
//to the correct path.

//use starwars code as a starter template for the assignment for the front end
//use vanilla script for back end as I am still not experienced with j-query
